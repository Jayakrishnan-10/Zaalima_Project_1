# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

🔗 **Project Link:**https://github.com/Jayakrishnan-10/Zaalima_Project_1

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.  
It focuses on handling highly imbalanced data and identifying fraud cases with high accuracy and recall.

This project was completed as part of a **one-month Data Science & Machine Learning internship**.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes major financial losses worldwide.  
The challenge is to build a model that can:
- Accurately detect fraudulent transactions  
- Handle class imbalance  
- Reduce false negatives (missed fraud cases)

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Understanding the dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection  
5. Model training  
6. Model evaluation  
7. Visualization using Power BI

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
- Credit card transaction dataset  
- Highly imbalanced:
  - **Class 0** → Normal transaction  
  - **Class 1** → Fraud transaction  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** – used as a baseline model  
- **Random Forest Classifier** – captures non-linear patterns and improves performance  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Because the dataset is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not sufficient.  
The following metrics were used:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Special emphasis was given to **Recall**, as detecting fraud cases is critical.
